at the NAC your personal and or groups details matter to us, thats why we collect it, store it and eventually use it to our advantage to make sure you never leave us!
the NAC is a multi-billion dollar industry that carries a monopoly on many aspects of your own lives, NAC services are able to be hired or leased to yourself but will always have a backside enterance for our staff to continue collecting
innocent peoples data to sell on the darkweb. This information may sound alarming but we can assure you that aslong as you are the one leasing or hiring our services you will not be affected nearly just as much as the people using the services!
